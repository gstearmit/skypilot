# Network interface  open port how?
To open a port on a SkyPilot cluster, you need to specify ports in the resources section of your task. Here is an example of a YAML configuration to expose a Jupyter Lab server:

# jupyter_lab.yaml
resources:
 ports: 8888

setup: pip install jupyter

run: jupyter lab --port 8888 --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0
In this example, the run command will start the Jupyter Lab server on port 8888. By specifying ports: 8888, SkyPilot will expose port 8888 on the cluster, making the jupyter server publicly accessible. To launch and access the server, run:

$ sky launch -c jupyter jupyter_lab.yaml
To get the public IP address of the head node of the cluster, run sky status --ip jupyter:

$ sky status --ip jupyter
35.223.97.21
In the jupyter server URL, replace 127.0.0.1 with the public IP from sky status --ip jupyter and open the URL in your browser.
If you want to expose multiple ports, you can specify a list of ports or port ranges in the resources section:

resources:
 ports:
 - 8888
 - 10020-10040
 - 20000-20010
SkyPilot also supports opening ports through the CLI:

$ sky launch -c jupyter --ports 8888 jupyter_lab.yaml
Please note that the ports you open are exposed to the public internet. Anyone who knows your VMâ€™s IP address and the opened port can access your service. Ensure you use security measures, like authentication mechanisms, to protect your services (source).
